# VBA-Resources

This is my list of resources I used to learn Excel and VBA and as a reference for my coding projects

## LEARN

### VIDEOS

1. Wise Owl Channel on youtube. Pretty simple and great for beginners.  (https://www.youtube.com/user/WiseOwlTutorials)
2. Excel Macro Mastery channel on youtube. A little more advanced channel. (https://www.youtube.com/c/Excelmacromastery)
3. Excel is fun channel on youtube. Focused on formulas, Power Query and DAX. (https://www.youtube.com/user/ExcelIsFun/videos)

### WEBSITES

1. By far one of the best websites to find interesting VBA code is CPearson. (http://www.cpearson.com/Excel/Topic.aspx)
2. Though obvious you can't leave out Stack Overflow for any VBA question. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vba)
3. I frequent Microsofts offical VBA documentation. Always a good resource though hard to read. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel)
4. Very basic but decent website for people starting out. (https://analystcave.com/excel-vba-tutorial/)

### BOOKS

1. The only book that I recommend is this one from John Walkenbach. (https://www.amazon.com/Excel-2013-Power-Programming-VBA/dp/1118490398)
